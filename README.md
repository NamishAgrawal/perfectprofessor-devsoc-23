# perfectprofessor-devsoc-23
project submission for devsoc-23
Our project aims at rating and reviewing professors to assist students during the ffcs phase that our students have to undergo. It is of great significance as it helps in removing misconceptions about teachers and promotes parity of information and allows students to decide on their professors , hence , making ffcs , truly , "fully flexible" in nature.
